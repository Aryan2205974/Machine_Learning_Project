Summary of Data Ingestion (data_ingestion.py)
The Data Ingestion module is responsible for loading and preparing the dataset for further processing. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key functionalities:
1.Loading the Dataset:

Reads data from a CSV file (stud.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.

2.Splitting the Data:

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.

3.Saving the Data:

The training and testing datasets are stored as separate CSV files:

train.csv (for model training)

test.csv (for model evaluation)

4.Logging and Exception Handling:

Implements logging to track errors and process status.

Uses a try-except block to handle errors during ingestion.

This step ensures that the data is properly organized before model training.
